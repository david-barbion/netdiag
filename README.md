# Installation

Before using netdiag, some librairies must be installed. Example for Ubuntu 16+:

```bash
sudo apt install ruby-dev libcairo-dev libappindicator-dev ruby-bundler
bundle install
```

Please note that this app uses ruby GTK2, since ruby-libappindicator relies on GTK2.

# Usage

Just run `netindic.rb`
